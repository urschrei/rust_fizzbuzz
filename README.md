# WHAT

Hi hi. This is just a first attempt at implementing Lindsey Kuper's excellent [Rust FizzBuzz](http://composition.al/blog/2013/03/02/fizzbuzz-revisited/) using Rust 1.0, as a way of taking some tentative first steps towards learning the language. 

This is by no means the most efficient (or fastest) way to do it (see [Chris Morgan's explorations](http://chrismorgan.info/blog/rust-fizzbuzz.html) for more), but I find the implementation particularly intuitive, and I do what I feel like.
